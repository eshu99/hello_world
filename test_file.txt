Hello I'm a test file.
Just exploring git.
It's great!

Rainbows are my fav!
The colors of rainbow.
Violet
Indigo
Blue
Green
Yellow
Orange
Red
With the rainy season out there I hope to spot a few of them :D
But yeah, should see them from home :(
Safety first! Covid -_-
Yea. 2020 says wait sth worse is cmng ur way!
But on a serious note, it has taught us the values of people, life, nature and many things which we have been taking as granted.
Yeah! we have emerged stronger and better.
