Hello I'm a test file.
Just exploring git.
It's great!

Rainbows are my fav!
The colors of rainbow.
Violet
Indigo
Blue
Green
Yellow
Orange
Red
With the rainy season out there I hope to spot a few of them :D
But yeah, should see them from home :(
Safety first! Covid -_-
Yea. 2020 says wait sth worse is cmng ur way!
But on a serious note, it has taught us the values of people, life, nature and many things which we have been taking as granted.
On the brighter side, it has taught us - to slow down and spend some self time, to value little things, a hygienic way of living. 
The nature has got back its lost glory! 
The most positive outcome Covid had, which would not have been possible otherwise even after spending lakhs of crores on it.
As every coin has two sides, we are staying away from our friends, the daily banters and fun are terribly being missed.
But yes, this too shall pass soon.
Yeah! we have emerged stronger and better.
